# Abstract

In order to enhance immersion in augmented reality systems, solutions must not only present a realistic rendering of the virtual objects, but also allow natural hand interactions. The main goal of this project was to utilize and introduce advanced techniques for the superimposition and manipulation of virtual objects over the view of the real world for mixed reality simulations. In this work, a board of markers was used for computing the camera pose seamlessly and a pinch gesture detection algorithm was implemented, employing userâ€™s thumb and forefinger to interact with the virtual content, using an RGB-D camera. Ultimately, a Mixed Reality Chess was developed, focused on providing an immersive experience to users, so that they are able to manipulate virtual chess pieces in front of a real table and play against a chess engine.
